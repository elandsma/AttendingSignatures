This is a React front end that I wrote as part of an internship.
The application queries for medical data from endpoints on a C# .NET back end. The medical data is presented to the user as cards which can be selected for 'digital signing'. An array of selected GUIDs get sent back to the database to be marked as signed, and the cases are then reloaded.
As this repository is public and the project was built for a private client, this code is left purposefully incomplete, with some redacted portions and no visible data or URLs, missing files, etc.

This was my first React project and as such, upon retrospect there are some inconsistencies and things I would change if doing this project again. It was a valuable learning experience.
